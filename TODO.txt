  TODO 
========

*) Create Block.GotoRequest(widget,bufferPos) bool
  - only place for Goto, SetFocus and Refresh calls
*) Make several types of widgets: 
  - focusable (eg edit, button): IsFocusable
  - nonfocusable (eg label): not IsFocusable and not IsMultiline
  - table (eg table): IsTable
*) Make all focusable widgets (eg edit) able to be standalone or used in table for multiline
  - if parent widget is IsTable, then widget is treated as column
  - no special column widget
*) Events: OnExitField, OnActionField, OnEnterRow, OnExitRow, OnEnterBlock, OnExitBlock
*) Single Fields (variable,stadalone), Multi Fields (row fields) in buffer
*) Buttons need to connect to field and reacts to OnActionField as Onclick
*) All connections should be made within widget constructors (buffer fields defined before)
*) All focusable widget should have label as integral part, label should be used as 
   label edit pair standalone, label button. or column label in table
*) Define several new interfaces instead of single Widget (FocusableWidget, TableWidget 
   as well as base Widget)

  IDEAS
=========

Cases:
1) From widget to widget by keypress (main onkeydown)
2) From widget to widget by click (main onfocus)
3) From widget to urlbar and back by keypress (main onfocus)
4) From widget to urlbar and back by click (main onfocus)
--
a) On focus out or onkeydown - remembers last widget,pos pair
b) On focus - calculate new widget,pos pair and calls Block.GotoRequest()
